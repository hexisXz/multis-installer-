to install gish just git clone https://github.com/xxhexisxx/gish-installer-.git and in the terminal type cd gish then type mv gish-installer ~ then go back to the home dir and type chmod +x gish-installer and then type ./gish-installer. the main project name is gish_ if you want to see it and my second project is py-gish.
